# GoldBadgeConsoleAppChallenges

This is the completed GitHub Repository for my Gold Badge Console Challenge projects. In this repository, you will see that I was able to complete challenges 1-7, mostly in their entirety.

Challenges 1-3 were completely finished (classes and repo, console, and unit tests), while challenges 4-7 were mostly completed (classes, repo, and console, but no unit tests).

The following challenges are included in this repository:

1. Cafe
2. Claims
3. Badges
4. Company Outings
5. Greeting
6. Green Plan
7. Barbecue

# Extra Notes
In these projects, there is one major assumption that I made. If the user is prompted to enter a property of a class that is not a string (for example, if the user is prompted to enter an ID number),
it is assumed that they will enter the correct type and nothing else. I asked one of the teachers about this and it was stated that this was a valid assumption for these challenges, so I decided to keep it as is.
If you were to enter something that did not fit the type (for example, a word when it asks for a number), there will be an error.
