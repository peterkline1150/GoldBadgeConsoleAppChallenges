# GoldBadgeConsoleAppChallenges

This is my GitHub Repository for my Gold Badge Challenges. I completed everything (classes and repo, console, and unit tests) for challenges 1-3, and I completed the console, classes, and repos (no unit tests) for challenges 4-7.

The projects that I completed are as follows:

1. Cafe
2. Claims
3. Badges
4. Company Outings
5. Greeting
6. Green Plan
7. Barbecue

# Extra Notes

In the console apps of my challenges, when the user is prompted to enter a property of a class, I am assuming that they are entering the correct type.

A teacher confirmed that this is a valid assumption, so I left it as is. This means that if you enter a double or any other type where there is supposed to be an int, there will be an error.

Other than that, I followed the prompts provided on Canvas and finished the projects to the best of my ability.

* All of these challenges were coded by Peter Kline without the help of anyone else. I did not share code with anyone else either.
