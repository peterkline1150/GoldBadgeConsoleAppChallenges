# GoldBadgeConsoleAppChallenges

This is my GitHub Repository for my Gold Badge Challenges. I completed everything (classes and repo, console, and unit tests) for challenges 1-3, and I completed the console, classes, and repos (no unit tests) for challenges 4-7.

The projects that I completed are as follows:

1. Cafe - Includes Menu class and Menu Repository, Unit Test for all Repository methods, and a console UI. The console allows the user to view the entire menu, add an item to the menu, and delete an item from the menu.
2. Claims - Includes a Claim class and a Claim Repository, Unit Test for all Repository methods, and a console UI. The console allows the user to view all claims, take care of the next claim in the queue, and enter a new claim into the queue.
3. Badges - Includes a Badge class and a Badge Repository, Unit test for all Repository methods, and a console UI. The console allows the user to add a new badge, edit an existing badge, list all current badges, remove a badge, and remove all doors from a certain badge.
4. Company Outings - Includes an Outing class, Outing Repository, and a console UI. The console allows the user to display a list of all outings, add an outing, view the cost of all outings combined, and view the cost of certain outings by type.
5. Greeting - Includes a Customer class, Customer Repository, and a console UI. The console allows the user to add a customer, show a list of all customers alphabetically (including a special email based on their details), update the details of a customer, and delete a customer.
6. Green Plan - Includes a Gas Car, Hybrid Car, and Electric Car class, along with corresponding interfaces. Also includes a Car Repository and a console UI. The console allows the user to add a specific car to the directory, view all cars of all types in the directory, view certain cars based on type in the directory, update a specific car in the directory, and delete a specific car in the directory.
7. Barbecue - Includes a Party class and Party repository. Includes two other classes (BurgerBooth and TreatBooth) which are used as properties of the Party class. This challenge also includes a console UI that allows the user to view a list of all parties, add a party (and show relevant data about the party and its cost), and delete a party.

# Extra Notes

In the console apps of my challenges, when the user is prompted to enter a property of a class, I am assuming that they are entering the correct type.

A teacher confirmed that this is a valid assumption, so I left it as is. This means that if you enter a double or any other type where there is supposed to be an int, there will be an error.

Other than that, I followed the prompts provided on Canvas and finished the projects to the best of my ability.

* All of these challenges were coded by Peter Kline without the help of anyone else. I did not share code with anyone else either.
